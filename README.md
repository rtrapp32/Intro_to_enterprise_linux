# 🐧 Linux Admin Lunch & Learn – Session 1

Welcome to Session 1 of the **Linux Admin Lunch & Learn** series!

This Obsidian vault contains the notes, slides, and demo commentary for my talk on **intro-level Linux administration**, 
focusing on RHEL-based systems (Rocky, CentOS, RHEL proper).

> "Linux isn’t hard, it’s just a lonely machine that only talks to people who learn its language."

## ✨ Why This Exists

I love Linux. I love helping folks *get it*. This is my attempt to pass on some mental models and tools I wish someone had just shown me early on. 
Hopefully, it helps you or someone on your team stop being afraid of `/etc` and start feeling confident SSHing into prod.

## 🧭 What’s Coming Next?

- **Session 2**: Ansible & Scripting  
  _For when you’re tired of SSHing into 12 boxes just to change one config. Let the robots suffer instead._

- **Session 3**: Linux PrivEsc  
  _Ascend to nobility, so **you TOO** can keep the peasantry from rising up and overthrowing the system (and PWNing your box)._

- **Session 4**: Database & SQL Basics  
  _From “what even is a database?” to “oh god this join won’t work.” Just enough relational power to survive log analytics and internal tools._

- **Session 5**: ???  
  _Probably something cursed. Or fun. Or both. Depends on how much tea I’ve had._
